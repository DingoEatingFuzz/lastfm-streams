Lastfm Streams
============

See what music your friends are listening to.

Overview
=======

An express site that gives you a one-glance no-clicks dashboard of your friends scrobbling on lastfm. It utilizes socket.io for maximal trendiness. 

Roadmap
=======

Still a work in progress; here's a checklist.
[ ] Filter out friends that aren't currently scrobbling.
[ ] Show "now playing" separate from the list.
    [ ] Slide the "now playing" track down the list when it finishes
[ ] Add more meta data to each listing
    [ ] Timestamp
    [ ] Artist name
    [ ] Image
[ ] Allow dragging and dropping lists for custom reordering
[ ] Parameterize the user instead of just using my account
[ ] Apply polish and stuff
